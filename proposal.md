# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Shagai naadgai - it is the name of a traditional game of my country. 
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A game that has two to three different variation of games using the same figures.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
It will have four "shagai", that would randomly be set by the user. The first game I'm thinking of will tell the fortune from the figures that landed. For the second game, the player would race to the point 32 and I will provide the rules of the game for the players as to how you would get points. I will execute this project on Pygame.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
None.
TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
I will be working by myself.
TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will have my first game ready no matter what and try to add more games if I can. 
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I want to have two to three variations of games using "shagai". As I've mentioned before, fortune teller, race to 32 points, and a game called turtle or horse racing.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
on top the two to three games, I want to have a little intro and ending animation with background music.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I would need to learn about how to code a game on Pygame. I will need to research more about probability and animation side of coding.
